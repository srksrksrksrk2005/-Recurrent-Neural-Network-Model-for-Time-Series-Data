# RNN Training with PyTorch

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to train a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** using **PyTorch**.

The notebook covers:

- Preparing sequential data
- Building an RNN model
- Defining loss function and optimizer
- Implementing the training loop
- Evaluating model performance

Recurrent Neural Networks are designed to process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps.
